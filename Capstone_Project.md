# Project Proposal 

> Testing different portfolio optimization algorithms.


## What is your project?

> This project can be seen as a starting point or an essential building block to build other investment solutions.
> Example for that, a digital asset management platform or Robo-advisor can utilize the outcomes to build and recommend a different solution to end-user.
> Alternatively, this can be used by individual investors and decide which portfolio algorithm to be followed, which empowers them and disintermediate DAMPs.
